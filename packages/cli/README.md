DESCRIPTION
  Build the app.

  This command executes the build script specified in the element's TOML file. You can specify a custom script in the
  file. To learn about configuration files in Shopify apps, refer to [App
  configuration](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration).

  If you're building a [theme app extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions), then
  running the `build` command runs [Theme Check](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-check) against your
  extension to ensure that it's valid.
```

_See code: [@shopify/app](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/edit/main/packages/app/blob/v3.52.0/dist/cli/commands/app/build.js)_

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy your Shopify app.

  [Builds the app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#build) and deploys app extensions.

  When you run this command, Shopify CLI creates an app version that contains a snapshot of all of your app extensions,
  including the app extensions that you manage in the Partner Dashboard, and releases the app version to users.

  This command doesn't deploy your [web app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/structure#web-components). When
  you're ready to deploy your app, you need to deploy these components to your own hosting solution. [Learn more about
  deploying your web app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web).

DESCRIPTION
  Run the app.

  [Builds the app](/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#build) and lets you preview it on a [development
  store](/docs/apps/tools/development-stores) or [Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/managi
  ng-stores/plus-sandbox-store?shpxid=f75d4b9f-3CE2-4156-F28E-0364F1AF6ABB).

  To preview your app on a development store or Plus sandbox store, Shopify CLI walks you through the following steps.
  If you've run `dev` before, then your settings are saved and some of these steps are skipped. You can reset these
  configurations using `dev --reset` to go through all of them again:

  - Associating your project with an app associated with your Partner account or organization, or creating a new app.
  - Selecting a development store or Plus sandbox store to use for testing. If you have only one store, then it's
  selected automatically.
  - Installing your app on the store using the provided install link.
  - Creating a tunnel between your local environment and the store using Cloudflare.

  You can use your own tunneling software instead, by passing your tunnel URL with the `--tunnel-url` flag.
  - Updating the app URLs that are set in the Partner Dashboard.

  To avoid overwriting any URLs that are already set, select the No, never option. If you select this option, then
  you're provided with URLs that you can manually add in the Partner Dashboard so you can preview your app.

  - Enabling development store preview for extensions.
  - Building and serving your app and app extensions.

  If you're using the PHP or Ruby app template, then you need to complete the following steps before you can preview
  your app for the first time:

  - PHP: [Set up your Laravel app](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-php#setting-up-your-laravel-app)
  - Ruby: [Set up your Rails app](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-ruby#setting-up-your-rails-app)

  > Caution: To use a development store or Plus sandbox store with Shopify CLI, you need to be the store owner, or have
  a staff account on the store. Staff accounts are created automatically the first time you access a development store
  with your Partner staff account through the Partner Dashboard.

  Uploads the current theme as the specified theme, or a [development
  theme](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli#development-themes), to a store so you can preview it.

  This command returns the following information:

  - A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot reload local changes to CSS and
  sections, or refresh the entire page when a file changes, enabling you to preview changes in real time using the
  store's data.

  You can specify a different network interface and port using `--host` and `--port`.

  - A link to the [editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/online-editor) for the theme in the Shopify admin.

  - A [preview link](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/themes/adding-themes?shpxid=cee12a89-AA22-4AD3-38C8-91
  C8FC0E1FB0#share-a-theme-preview-with-others) that you can share with other developers.

  If you already have a development theme for your current environment, then this command replaces the development theme
  with your local theme. You can override this using the `--theme-editor-sync` flag.

  > Note: You can't preview checkout customizations using http://127.0.0.1:9292.

  Development themes are deleted when you run `shopify auth logout`. If you need a preview link that can be used after
  you log out, then you should [share](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands#share) your theme or
  [push](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands#push) to an unpublished theme on your store.

  You can run this command only in a directory that matches the [default Shopify theme folder
  structure](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli#directory-structure).

  Clones a Git repository to use as a starting point for building a new theme.

  Clones a Git repository to your local machine to use as the starting point for building a theme.

  If no Git repository is specified, then this command creates a copy of [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn),
  Shopify's example theme, with the specified name in the current folder. If no name is provided, then you're prompted
  to enter one.

  the theme that you submit needs to be [substantively different from
  Dawn](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/store/requirements#uniqueness) so that it provides added value for users. Learn

## `shopify shopify webhook trigger [flags]`

Trigger delivery of a sample webhook topic payload to a designated address.

```
USAGE
  $ shopify shopify webhook trigger [flags]

FLAGS
  --address=<value>
      The URL where the webhook payload should be sent.
      You will need a different address type for each delivery-method:
      · For remote HTTP testing, use a URL that starts with https://
      · For local HTTP testing, use http://localhost:{port}/{url-path}
      · For Google Pub/Sub, use pubsub://{project-id}:{topic-id}
      · For Amazon EventBridge, use an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) starting with arn:aws:events:

  --api-version=<value>
      The API Version of the webhook topic.

  --client-secret=<value>
      Your app's client secret. This secret allows us to return the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header that lets you validate
      the origin of the response that you receive.

  --delivery-method=<option>
      Method chosen to deliver the topic payload. If not passed, it's inferred from the address.
      <options: http|google-pub-sub|event-bridge>

  --help
      This help. When you run the trigger command the CLI will prompt you for any information that isn't passed using
      flags.

  --shared-secret=<value>
      Deprecated. Please use client-secret.

  --topic=<value>
      The requested webhook topic.

DESCRIPTION
  Trigger delivery of a sample webhook topic payload to a designated address.


  Triggers the delivery of a sample Admin API event topic payload to a designated address.

  You should use this command to experiment with webhooks, to initially test your webhook configuration, or for unit
  testing. However, to test your webhook configuration from end to end, you should always trigger webhooks by performing
  the related action in Shopify.

  Because most webhook deliveries use remote endpoints, you can trigger the command from any directory where you can use
  Shopify CLI, and send the webhook to any of the supported endpoint types. For example, you can run the command from
  your app's local directory, but send the webhook to a staging environment endpoint.

  To learn more about using webhooks in a Shopify app, refer to [Webhooks
  overview](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/webhooks).

  ### Limitations

  - Webhooks triggered using this method always have the same payload, so they can't be used to test scenarios that
  differ based on the payload contents.
  - Webhooks triggered using this method aren't retried when they fail.
  - Trigger requests are rate-limited using the [Partner API rate
  limit](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/partner#rate_limits).
  - You can't use this method to validate your API webhook subscriptions.
```
