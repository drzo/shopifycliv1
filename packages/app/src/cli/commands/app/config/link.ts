  This command presents you with a prompt with the following steps:

  - Which Partner organization is this work for?
    - This prompt shows only if the account you are logged into has more than one organization.
  - Create this project as a new app on Shopify?
    - Choosing yes will create a new app in your Partner Dashboard with the default configuration
    - Choosing no will prompt you to choose from a list of all the apps in your organization
  - Configuration file name
    - Enter the name for this configuration file. The \`shopify.app.{config-name}.toml\` file will be created. If it already exists, you will be prompted to confirm overwriting.

  For more information on the format of the created TOML configuration file, refer to the [App configuration](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration) page.
